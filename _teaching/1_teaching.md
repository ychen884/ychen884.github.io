### My Reflections
This course provides a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental design principles of computer networks, examined through the lens of various layers.

#### Why should you consider this course?
I strongly recommend this course if you're keen to understand the foundational concepts behind the diverse services we enjoy today, such as streaming, file storage, messaging, and more.

#### What about the workload?
Compared to other senior-level programming courses at UW-Madison, this course offers a moderate workload.

The projects involve the implementation of a range of applications using Java and Mininet, including performance analysis tools using mininet and sockets, link/network layer forwarding functionality, ARP/IP/ICMP, SDN, DNS, and flow control. There's also an optional project on distributed sorting. These projects provide practical exposure to network design, reinforcing the theoretical concepts covered in the course.
