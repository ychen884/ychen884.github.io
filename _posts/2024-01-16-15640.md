### Course Evaluation (Final grade: N/A)
I will add my course evaluation at the end of this semester.

## ** Chapter 1: Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ** <a name="topic-1"></a>
- Try to fake procedure call to local programming
- Why? bring down programming complexity for distributed systems 
- client-server model, per interface
- two aspects: control flow, invocation syntax
- with network delays (theoretically best at speed of light)

##### limitations of RPC 
1. No address space sharing between client and server, can't sharing pointers(call by reference), can't share global data..
2. Delayed binding in RPC

##### Failure independence
- caller and callee live and die together in local setup
- we can witness failure case but hard to do in local
- failure handling consider visibility of failure
- Security: different domains

##### Typical RPC
- client: makerpc(request_packet, &reply_packet): blocks until reply or failure
- server: getrequest(&request_packet) blocks until receives request, sendresponse(reply_packet)

##### Stub routines
- generated by stub generator
- sit between high level purpose and low level network packing/unpacking send/recv..
```
-> : local procedure call
----: network communication

        Client                                             Server
App -> Stub -> Transport -----Network Com------ Transport -> Stub -> App

App calls Stub
Stub pack/unpack
Transport transmit/receive
Server App do actual work then return
Packing and unpacking is usually not elastic in dev env
Correctness and API design is more important

```
- Marshalling/Unmarshalling, Serialization/De-serialization

##### RPC packet format
1. Network transport header(Ethernet, IP, Transport(TCP/UDP))
2. RPC header
```
RPC Version ID
Opcode (Stub)
Flags
parameters + Len

```

##### Stub with dynamically allocated buffer
- variable to indicate how many bytes in coming
- malloc for new memories
