## ** Chapter 1: Overview of Cloud Computing ** <a name="topic-1"></a>
#### Definitions

##### Properties:
- Computing utility, always available, accessible through the networks
- Simplified interface
- Statistical multiplexing, sharing resources
- Economies of scale from consolidation, costs lower
- Capital costs converted to operating costs
- Rapid and easy variation of usage
- Appearance of infinite resources with small users
- Pay only for what you use
- Cost conservation: 1 unit for 1000 hours == 1000 units for 1 hour

##### Consolidation, sharing, elasticity
- CLT theory
- users with widely varying needs apply a considerably less variable load on a huge provider, allowing providers to do less overprovisioning. 
- - Because of CLT, it is predictable for the overall load which causes less overprovisioning.
- Users perceive exactly what they need all the time, if their needs are “small”(so the accessed resources are appearing as infinite)

##### SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
- SaaS: service as application (Salesforce)
- PaaS: high-level programming model for cloud computer, Turing complete but resource management hidden. (Google AppEngine)
- IaaS:  low-level computing model for cloud computer (AWS)

##### XXX as a Service
- Data as a Service, Network as a Service, Communication as a Service(No hardware private VOIP switching), IT as a Service(IT providing services)..

##### Deployment models
```
public cloud: provider sells computing to unrelated consumers
private cloud: largely unrelated components and divisions as consumers
community cloud: providers and consumers are different organizations with strong shared concerns
Hybrid cloud: private plus public resources combined by same consumer. Better availability, overflow from private to public, load balancing to increase elasticity
```
##### Larry Ellison’s objection
- definition is including too much
<!-- ● E.g., timesharing: many users slice up a single big computer
○ Virtualize the hardware as protected processes with shared storage
○ Accumulate usage accounting for billing/cost-sharing
● E.g., client-server computing: program API for communication
○ Relieve clients from burden of operating, provisioning server
○ Set abstraction of server function at a natural/constrained level
● E.g., leasing companies – spread the cost over computer lifetime
○ Rates depend on commitment: 100% -> prime rate loan,
lower commitment to pay leads to high “interest” rates -->



##### load balancing approach
##### 1. DNS load balancing
- DNS reorder the list for each client asking for translation of name
- PRO: easy to scale, unrelated to actual TCP/HTTP requests
- CON: new server may get less resources if scheduling more servers, dynamic changing is hard because it has to tell client for a binding(existing binding exists due to TTL, caching in network middleboxes). 


##### 2. Router distribute TCP connections 
- Router do the mapping: (client_ip+client_port) <-> (server_ip+server_port)
- - for SYN packets
- - not exposed to client about the ip address(like NAT)


- PRO: router doesn't have to think or remember too much, *it just selected the server with least connnection to schedule for the new connections.
- CON: traffic all go through the router(more difficult to scale), and decision takes time cuz it's for the entire session


#### 3. Router distribute individual quests embedded in connections
<!--  -->
- PRO: most dynamic
- CON: requires the most processing and state in the router, CPU load and memory goes up due to intelligent routing decisions.
#### Elasticit: How? Elasticity controller
- Elasticity controller to adjust load capability based on current load status
- Monitoring: resource usage, request sequence(patterns)
- Triggering: (simple conditions like thresholds), schedule, complex model based on monitored instances

#### Elasticity: Scale-out or Scale up
- Horizontal scaling: adding more instances (Common approach)
- Vertical scaling: Resizing the resources(bdw, cpu cores, memory) allocated to an existing instances, challenging(different OS.) More challenging.

#### Two-tier services
- web-database
- web server easy to be in cloud. At beginning, order-taking is not in cloud.
- Elasticity in IaaS: database scaling is more difficult with state(consistency)
- PassS, P=Web Service. Built-in elastic load balancing and scheduled actions for containers, persistent key-value store (datastore) & non-persistent memcache
for simple database tier, Users can instantiate Backends, user code can request (actuate) horizontal scaling, running traditional database services, whose scaling is still hard.

##### Load-balancing method affect how much statistics we can get. 
- Router-based load balancing: firewall, intrusion detection, accelerator
- scaling middleboxes: CPU intensive tasks. (OpenFlow, split flows)
- bdw allocation by sw/rt

##### Service parallelization: Load Balancer
- aws cloud watch
- Load balancer is not necessarily elastic

##### Scalable relational database
- Separate data at rest(distributed pay-for-use storage (HDFS)) from ongoing or recent access & mutation
- Recent access & mutation servers are elastic (called Owning Transaction Managers)
- Partitioned but all transactions restricted to one partition: transactions block on locks and bottleneck performance scaling
- Fault-tolerance of Elastic controller.  Controller itself, reliability provided by replication. Can re-assigns partitions while server is down/start up.

##### ElasTraS architecture scales OTM machines
- Transactions are limited to interacting with data from only one partition to avoid the complexity of distributed transactions.

Cloud computing: what brings it? large capital outlays, overprovisioning/underprovisioning...

Definition: Refers to both the applications as services over the internet and hardware and systems software in the data center that provide those services. The services themselves: SaaS. Services being sold is utility computing. Cloud computing = SaaS + utility computing. It has to be large enough to be called cloud. Hardware provisioning/pricing: 1. inifinite computing resources available on demand; 3. elimination of an up-front commitment by cloud users, add resources when needed; 4. pay for use of computing resources temporarily. *Construction and operaition of extremely large-scale, commodify-computer data centers at low-cost locations was the key necessary enabler of cloud computing. It could offer services below the costs of a medium-sized data center and make profits.

Utility Computing classes: EC2 with low level control but less automatic scalability and failover(application may need to control the replication...). Google AppEngine(domain specific platforms) on the other hand. Azure is in between. 

Economics: Favor cloud computing over conventional: 1. demand of services changes over time 2. demand is unknown
usage based pricing economically benefits the buyer. 
Elasticity helps reduce the costs. Underprovisioning has a cost that is difficult to measure: the users may never come back. Scale-up elasticity is an operational requirement, and scale-down elasticity allowed the steady state expenditure to more closely match the steady-state workload. 


Obstacles for Cloud computing:

1-3(adoption):
1. Business Continuity and Service Availability
2. 
3. 

4-8(growth):


9-10(policy and business):
Privacy & security
○ How is this different from outsourcing payroll, legal, HR, email?
○ Its new so standard practice, certifications, insurance etc not in place
○ Its often business critical/proprietary (topline revenue providing)
○ Running aside other users opens unknown attack channels
● Privacy in the world tends to rely on regulation
○ we know encryption is too weak for safety from very big organizations
○ will cloud also need to rely on regulation for privacy?
