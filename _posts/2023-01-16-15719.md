### Course Evaluation (Final grade: N/A)
I will add my course evaluation at the end of this semester.
### Paper reading notes
I will upload my paper reviews here later.

Cloud computing: what brings it? large capital outlays, overprovisioning/underprovisioning...

Definition: Refers to both the applications as services over the internet and hardware and systems software in the data center that provide those services. The services themselves: SaaS. Services being sold is utility computing. Cloud computing = SaaS + utility computing. It has to be large enough to be called cloud. Hardware provisioning/pricing: 1. inifinite computing resources available on demand; 3. elimination of an up-front commitment by cloud users, add resources when needed; 4. pay for use of computing resources temporarily. *Construction and operaition of extremely large-scale, commodify-computer data centers at low-cost locations was the key necessary enabler of cloud computing. It could offer services below the costs of a medium-sized data center and make profits.

Utility Computing classes: EC2 with low level control but less automatic scalability and failover(application may need to control the replication...). Google AppEngine(domain specific platforms) on the other hand. Azure is in between. 

Economics: Favor cloud computing over conventional: 1. demand of services changes over time 2. demand is unknown
usage based pricing economically benefits the buyer. 
Elasticity helps reduce the costs. Underprovisioning has a cost that is difficult to measure: the users may never come back. Scale-up elasticity is an operational requirement, and scale-down elasticity allowed the steady state expenditure to more closely match the steady-state workload. 


Obstacles for Cloud computing:
1-3(adoption):
1. Business Continuity and Service Availability
2. 
3. 

4-8(growth):
9-10(policy and business):



Opportunities:

## ** Chapter 1: Overview of Cloud Computing ** <a name="topic-1"></a>
#### Definitions

##### Properties:
- Computing utility, always available, accessible through the networks
- Simplified interface
- Statistical multiplexing, sharing resources
- Economies of scale from consolidation, costs lower
- Capital costs converted to operating costs
- Rapid and easy variation of usage
- Appearance of infinite resources with small users
- Pay only for what you use
- Cost conservation: 1 unit for 1000 hours == 1000 units for 1 hour

##### Consolidation, sharing, elasticity
- CLT theory
- users with widely varying needs apply a considerably less variable load on a huge provider, allowing providers to do less overprovisioning?
- 


private cloud: 
public cloud: provider sells computing to unrelated consumers
surge computing 
hybrid cloud computing

##### load balancing approach
- CON: new machines may get less resources if scheduling more servers

##### Router distribute TCP connections 
- Router do the mapping: (client_ip+client_port) <-> (server_ip+server_port)

- PRO: router doesn't have to think or remember too much, it just selected the server with least connnection to schedule for the new connections.
- CON: traffic all go through the router, and decision takes time cuz it's for the entire session


#### Router distribute individual quests embedded in connections
<!--  -->
- PRO: most dynamic
- CON: requires the most processing and state in the router, CPU load and memory goes up


#### Elasticity: Scale-out or Scale up
- Horizontal scaling: adding more instances (Common approach)
- Vertical scaling: Resizing the resources allocated to an existing instances, challenging(different OS.) but possible

##### Load-balancing method affect how much statistics we can get. 
#### Elasticity controller

#### Scaling the virtual network
