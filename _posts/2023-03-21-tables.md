Using markdown to display tables is easy. Just use the following syntax:

```markdown
| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left 1       | center 1       | right 1       |
| Left 2       | center 2       | right 2       |
| Left 3       | center 3       | right 3       |
```

That will generate:

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left 1       | center 1       | right 1       |
| Left 2       | center 2       | right 2       |
| Left 3       | center 3       | right 3       |

<p></p>

It is also possible to use HTML to display tables. For example, the following HTML code will display a table with [Bootstrap Table](https://bootstrap-table.com/), loaded from a JSON file: -->

<!-- {% raw  %}
```html
<table
  id="table"
  data-toggle="table"
  data-url="{{ '/assets/json/table_data.json' | relative_url }}">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th data-field="id">ID</th>
      <th data-field="name">Item Name</th>
      <th data-field="price">Item Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>
```
{% endraw  %} -->

The University of Wisconsin-Madison offers an exceptional Computer Science track for undergraduate students, enabling them to delve into various fields within the discipline. During my undergraduate studies, I concentrated on system courses, which allowed me to gain valuable insights into this specialized area.

Below is a breakdown of the courses I undertook at UW-Madison. The advanced courses have been highlighted at the beginning of the list for emphasis. I am profoundly grateful to my instructors, whose dedication and passion have significantly shaped my academic journey. Their guidance, coupled with my relentless hard work and consistent efforts, has truly made a difference in my education.

The courses at UW-Madison are categorized into three distinct levels:

Elementary (E): Typically, entry-level courses designed for freshmen and sophomores.
Intermediate (I): These courses are aimed at students in their sophomore to junior years.
Advanced (A): Targeted at students in their junior to senior years, these courses focus on more specialized and complex topics.
The education I received at UW-Madison has not only broadened my knowledge but also laid a solid foundation for my future pursuits in the field of Computer Science.
