### Course Evaluation (Final grade: A)
This course is designed for individuals with minimal or no prior knowledge of computer networks. It delves into the intricate details of various protocols. The exams are generally easy to manage, but the labs may demand a significant amount of effort. Students should be aware that they will be sharing server resources with many others, leading to potential issues with resource contention.
It also includes reviews of some state-of-the-art papers in the field.

### Paper reviews
