### Broad Overview of Fundamental Principles
- Fundamentals of the protocol stack
- Networking tools & protocols
- Paper reading


### Top-down approach 
- Applciation Layer + overlays
- Transport Layers
- Network Layers
- Data Link Layer

### Introduction to Networking 
#### Hosts as ending systems, running network apps 
- Connected with using communication links (fiber, copper, radio, WIFI, satellite, etcs) 
- Bandwidth

#### "Nuts & bolts" view
- Protocols: like TCP, IP, HTTP, UDP, DNS, ARP, etcs
#### Network of networks 
- Loosely hierarchical
- Public vs private networks
- Internet Service Provders(ISPS)
#### Standards 
- RFC: Request for Comments
- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Forces
#### "Services" view
- Communication infrastructure, enabling distributed applications
- Communication services, provided to applications, connectionless or connection-oriented

### What is a PROTOCL?
- Human protocls: A->B: "What's the time?" B->A: "12:00"
- Define the format, order of messages sent and recieved among network entities, and the actions taken on message transmission or receipt.
- All communication activity on the Internet is governed by Protocols


### Network Structure
#### Network Edge: Hosts running apps, Clients and Servers
- End systems(hosts): running apps, source or destination of network data
- Client/Server model: a client asks for and gets services from an "always-on" server. Web browser/Web Server
- Peer-to-peer model: Minimal use of dedicated servers. Peers host files for other peers. 

### Connection-orientated Communication Services
- Goal: Reliable data transfer between end systems
- Requires handshaking before sending data
- Provides Reliability
- Example: TCP in Transport Layer

### Different services for different applications
- TCP: HTTP, FTP, Telnet(remote login), SMTP(email)
- UDP: DNS, Skype(VOIP), Streaming media, Zoom(Teleconferencing)

#### Network Cores: Routers, Interconnected Networks, "Network of networks"
- A mesh of interconnected routers
- Circuit switching: Discrete paths, end-to-end resoures reserved for the connection, no sharing with other connections
- Network bandwidth is divided into pirces, allocated to connections, and idle if not used by the connection owner
- FDM, TDM

Users use different freq
 Freq   -----------
        -----------

        TIme
````

Either: Devide the available bdw / slots

Frequency is measured by Hz. 
Assuming pipe is thin, so only some number of parallel bits.
Additional frequency more bits, more channel less bits per time slot

or Users use full freqs for per time slot

example: 
How long does it take to send a file of 640000bits from A to B over a circuit-switched network?
Each link uses TDM with 24 slots
500 msec to build the end-to-end circit
All links with bandwith 1.536Mbps

TDM splits the transmission rate among all slots, A single-circuit transmission rate is 1.536Mbps/24 = 64Kbps
10 sec + 500ms = 10.5 seconds



### Packet switching: Discrete chunks of data, every packet uses the full bdw of a link (no TDM/FDM)
- Packet moved hop by hop, routed.
- \+ Connectionless/Stateless
- \+ No resource sharing
- \- Resource contention: Aggregate demand can exceed available resources in the intermediate routers
- \- Congestion: Packet wait in routers' queues, waiting to user the whole link
- \- Packet arrive from multiple sources
- \- Packet can be dropped if demnand is too high

### Statistical Multiplexing
- Packets go from different sources, to the same router
- packets arrive in random/statistical order

Pattern has to be determined by some means of statistical methods.

### Store-and-forward Model

- For a packet of L bits
- On a link of R bps throughput (bdw)
- Takes L/R seconds to transmit the packet (Transmission time)
- The entire packet (all the bits) must arrive at the router before it can be transmitted to next node.
- Example: 7.5Mb/1.5Mbps = 5 seconds

```markdown
Host A ---- R bps ----> Node B ----- Rbps ------> Node C ---- Rbps ---> Host B
All links are 1.5 Mbps
Send a 7.5 Mb file:
Time = 7.5Mb/1.5Mbps = 5 sec (ignoring propogation, queueing, setup time)
Why not 15 sec? Packet switching, we can see packet granularity helps!

If 5000 packets of each 1500 bits
Time at which the second packt reached the end: 1 msec after packet 1
Time to forward a packet in a link: 1500 bits/1.5 Mbps = 1 msec
Time at which the first packet reached the end: 3 msec
Totla time: 3 msec + 4999 * 1 msec = 5.002 sec: nice improvements!
```

### Packet vs circuit switching
- Allows more users
- Imagine a 1 Mbps link
- n users: Active 10% of the tie, using 100Kbps when active
- Max n for circuit switching: 10 users
- Max n for packet switching: 

With 40 users, the probability of > 10 being active is < 0.001
Calculate probability

### Is packet switching the answer?
- \+ Great for burst data
- \+ Resources are shared
- \+ Simpler: no circuit set-up / reservations

- \- More packets that cannot be queued and handles 
- - Packet delay and loss 
- - Must add protection (complexity) for reliable transmission and congestion control




<!-- #### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Lec 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

### Delay and Loss in Packet Switching Networks 
#### Sources of delay/loss
- Before transmission, packets queue in router buffers
- Store process and forward once all the bits are received
- Packet arrival rate may exceed output capacity

#### Delay types
- Processing Delay: Time spent in the router: check for bit errors(checksums), determine the output link(next hop)
- Queueing Delay: Each output link in a router stores packets in a queue(buffer), depends on the congestion level of the router and the transmission algorithms.
- Transmission Delay: T = L/R time to transmit packet, place all the packet bits in the link
- Propagation Delay: $2.8 * 10^8$ m/s, bits travelling through a medium (fiber, wireless,..)

### Nodal delay
dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop => dnodal 
- why queueing delay depends on network congestions? depends on statistical multiplexing. (0~few ms) 

### Queuing delay 
L = packet length (bits/pkt)
R = link speed (bps)
λ = average packet arrival rate
Traffic intensity (ρ) = $L * λ / R$
- if ~ 0: average queueing delay is small
- =1: delayes become large, a small increase in traffic substantially increases the delay
- greater than 1: More packet arriving than can be processed, the average delay goes to infinity


### Packet loss
- queue preceding link in the router has a finite capacity
- When a packet arrives in a full queue, the packet is dropped
- A packet packet may be retransmitted by the previous node, by the source end system, not retransmited at all

### Real delays
- Tool: traceroute provides delay measurements for each hop in the path
- For all routers i in some path:
- Send 3 packets(probes) that will reach router i on the path roward the destination
- The router i will respond to the sender
- Measure transmission and reply interval
- Info: Intermediate router, 3 delay measurements, can have different routes if congested/lost

### Networks are complex! How to organize
- Many components, many layers
#### What architecture should be used?
- Layered Network Architecture
- Set of layers, each of them: provides a service(defined in a protocol), specifies an interface for accessing the service
- User services of the layer direcly
### Network architecture defines all the layers and the design of protocols/interfaces for each layer

### Why layering? 
#### Decompose the complex networking problem into managable pieces
- Monolithic non-layered architectures are costly, inflexible, and soon obsolete.
- Structured way to understand
- Protocol in each layer can be developed seperately from those in other layers
- Implementation in a layer can change wihtout affecting other layers, as long as the interface remains the same
- Details not required in lower layers
- Simplifies the design, implementation and testing

### Why not layering?
- Duplication of lower-layer functions, reliability at link + transport layer
- Information hiding affects performance, may require info from lower layers

### ISO OSI Reference Model
### ISO: International Standard Organization
#### OSI: Open Systems Interconnection was a reference framwork to enable multi-vendor interconnection (interoperability)
- Provides a unified view of layers, services, and protocols in each layer
- Not well introduced, as TCP/IP pre-empted deployment of OSI protocols

### Application

### Presentation

### Session

### Transport
- End-to-end transfer of messages (i.e., segments)
- Port numbers enable the multiplexing of various apps
- Message segmentations and reassembly
- Connection setup, maintenance, and release

### Network
- Transport packets across links
- Scalable addressing: Hierarchically
- Routing protocol: determine best paths..
- Example: IPv4 & IPv6



### Data Link
- Transfer frames between 2 adjacent nodes (directly connected)
- A frame is a sequence of bits or blocks of information
- Inserts control, addressing, and error correction info
- Activation, maintenance, and deactivation of link connection
- Example: Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, Wi-Fi


### Physical
- Transfer bits across a link


## **Chapter 2: Design Principles** <a name="topic-2"></a>
[Back to Blog Chapters](#blog-chapters)

#### Layer Virtual Connection 

- virtual/logical connections between peer layers
- The real conenction is physical layer


#### Encapsulation/Decapsulation
```
(Sender) -> Higher Layer -> encap -> Lower layer -> send -> Lower layer -> decap -> Higher layer -> (Receiver)


```
#### 1. Is strict layering implied?
- No. User Applications are free to bypass the defined transport layer and to directly use IP

#### 2. "Hourglass" Figure!

- Above IP and Below IP: lots of stuff, IP is the glue

```

------------APPS---------------
HTTP, SMTP, NTP, DHCP, DNS, SIP
--------TCP, UDP---------------
-----------IP------------------
LTE,3G, WIFI, Ethernet, DOCSIS, DSL
Radiom Coaxial, Fiber, Twisted Pair


```

#### 3. IETF, Internet Engineering Task Force
- For a new protocol to become standard
- defailed protocol specification, tested
- 2+ independent implementation
- rough consesus and running code


#### Sidebar: Request for Comments (RFC)
- Every IETF standard is published as a RFC
- Not all RFCs are standards! Experimental, Information doc, Historical standards..

#### Clark Fundamental Goal 
- Interconnect existing networks 
- Store-and-forward packet-switching and adding gateways to connect them together


#### Second Level Goal
• Continue despite the loss of networks or gateways
• Support multiple types of communication services
• Accommodate a variety of network technologies – Ethernet, ATM
• Permit distributed management of its resources
• Be cost-effective (?)
• Account for resources used (?)

#### Where should I store the “state” of our connection
• Approach # 1: In the intermediate nodes (gateways)
• Requires replication of state everywhere
• Difficult to build algorithms
• Synchronization issues
• Approach # 2: At the end-hosts
• If the end host is lost, the state associated with its
conversation is also lost
• Much easier to engineer than replication

#### Stateless NEtwork Core
- The original TCP/IP design uses approach 2
- also called datagram entwork
- end-hosts ensure reliable delivery of data

#### Intelligence of Internet Devices
- Dumb routers, just forwarding
- Smart hosts, do more: reliability, flow control, congestion conrol, buffering


#### Types of Services
- TCP is thought to be enough, but reliability is the main source of delay!
- Tradeoffs always exist between latency and reliability
- Originally, TCP and IP were at the same layer
- - TCP is not always helpful! Then IP to be the basic building blocks: datagrams

#### Distributed Management
- Mostly achieved
- Networks can be administered seperately
- - Still a big issue

#### Accouting of Resources
- Little to the original design
- TODAY: Coarse-grained tools are widely use, recent tools measure and monotor traffic based on flows, source/destination pairs 


#### Saltzer84 PAPER
- end-to-end argument, eliminating dup function
- exception: performance optimization: A lower layer could implement a higher layer function if it
is for improving (overall) performance

#### Moving Away? 
- Operation in an unstructworthy world
- More demanding apps
- Growth of end0hosts, IOT devices
- Moving away from end-to-end argument
- Routers are getting smarter (QoS, SDN, accouting and mangement)

## **Chapter 4:HTTP, application layer** <a name="topic-4"></a>
[Back to Blog Chapters](#blog-chapters)
#### for user apps
#### Abstract details of the transport layer
- user transport servicesL mainly TCP and UDP 

#### Application Layer != User Appliccation
- provides services to user appplications with the network accessibility
- Enables access to lower layers like transport layer
- Services include email, ftp, http, web accesss, telnet access on a remote host, ...

#### TL setup overhead
- It takes time to initiate and close the transport connection (handshake,..)

#### Main ops
##### Missions
- provide users with access to network resources
- provide services to user apps
##### Addressing
- specific addressing
- domain names, email addresses, etcs
##### Data type
- Messages 


#### HTTP vs HTTPs
- With encrption or not

#### Overview
- Client/Server apps
- Client: browse that requests, receives and renders web objects
- Server: stores web objects and sends in response to client requests
- Generic, not considering the OS

#### History Lesson
- 0.9, original release
- 1.0, RFCs for HTML and URI were publish in the same year
- - HTML: Format for documents that are displayed in a web browser (web pages)
- - URI: Identity resoruces on the web
- Problems:
- - Caching control
- - TCP overhead for shot responses
- HTTP/1.1
- - this will be discussed in detail in this blog
- HTTP2
- - somwhow slow adoption rate
- - change how data is transfered
- - compress hreaders
- - allow server push: for example, google server pushes the image to the client, so client does not have to ask for the logo image from the reference link


#### HTML 
- Defines the meaning and structure of web contents
- - other tech used for appearance(CSS) or functionality(JS)
- HTML uses 'markup' to annotate text, images, and contents for display in a web browser


#### Web and HTTP: Message Format
- Two types of HTTP messages (identities: client c, server s):
- - Requests from c to s
- - Responses from s to c
- Specificed in header BN format request | response
- Same generic format for request and response
- - Start line or status line (Request or Response)
- - Zero or more headers
- - An empty line
- - A message body


```
generic-message = star-kine 
*(message-header CRLF(return))
CRLF
[message-body]
start-line = Request-line | status-line
```
#### What are those headers? 
- dates/times
- application or server info
- caching control
- 46 defined headers
- Host: is reqiured on requests

#### HTTP Request-line
- Request-Line = Methods SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
- Methods: "OPTIONS" | "GET | "HEAD | "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE"

#### Request Methods (GET):
- "Conditional GET": get only if a condition is met, the header would include if-modified-since, if-match, etc.
- "Partial GET": Get only a portion of the file, the header includes a RANGE field
- - essential for restartale tranders such as buffering a media stream
- - Gets only a set of bytes from the original msg
- POST: upload data to a server
- HEAD: retrieve metadata about an object(validity, modification time, etc)
- - Same as GET but MUST NOT return a message body
- OPTIONS: request info about the capabilities of the server wihtout requesting the resources


#### HTTP Response format
- start-line = request-line | status-line
- status-line = HTTP-version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
- Status Code: 
- - 1xx: Infomational, received request, continuing process
- - 2xx: Success, action successful
- - 3xx: Redirection, further action is required to complete this req
- - 4xx: Client error, request has bad syntax or cannot be fullfilled
- - 5xx: Server error, server failed to fullfill a valid request



#### RTT of HTTP (non-persistent)
- Response time = 2RTT + file transmit time 
- One RTT to initiate a TCP connection
- One RTT for HTTP request and the first byte of the response
- Non-persistent HTTP: has to establish a tcp connection for each file transmission!
- - High overhead in terms of packets in the network
- - Long user-perceived latency

#### Persistent HTTP
- Reuse the existing TCP connection
- Pilelining at the pplicaiton protocl level, send batched req for batched recv, for less latency (less RTTs)


#### Web Proxy Caching
- acts as both server and clients
- reduces response time for user reqs
- reduces trafic on access linkes
- - reduces transit cost

#### File Consistency
- HTTP ensures the correctness of caching, TTL

#### Protocl is not Policy
- Web cache policy is seperate from the protocol
- cache replacement... 

#### Expiration Model
- Origin server-specified expiratrion
- - Uses Expires header or max-age directive in Cache-Control header
- - Recommended
- Heuristic expiration
- - up to the web cache implementation
- Freshness calculation
- - age and expiration calculations
- - is a cache entry fresh? 

#### Validation Model
- Fresh or not? 
- If-modified-since [date]



## **Chapter 7:TCP, transport layer** <a name="topic-7"></a>
[Back to Blog Chapters](#blog-chapters)
- Logical communication
- End-to-end communication
#### Netork layer: best efforts
- does not provide reliability 
- or any other: bdw, sec, timeliness

### Transport Layer main protocols
- Key funcs: multiplex and de-multiplex applications (processes), using port numbers, range from 0 to 65535(1<<16)
- Breaking data into appropriate size pieces, called segments, and re-assembly at the receiver
- connection setup, state management, teardown
- TCP: reliability guarantees, flow control, congestion control, mechanisms, etc


#### TCP
- only pass messages to application layer only if it is correct

#### UDP
- not offering any reliability
- Best effort service
- does not provide reliability, segments can be out of order
- smaller header than tcp
- no congestion or flow control
- Can build application layer to support specific requirements
- Used for multimedia applications, loss tolerant, rate sensitive, big overhead compared to transmitted data
- Checksum: error(flipped bits)

##### Connectionless
- No handshaking
- No previous agreement before sending the data
- Each segment is handled independently

#### Binding
- port numbers are bound to an app

#### Segmentation
