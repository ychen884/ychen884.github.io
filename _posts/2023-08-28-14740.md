## Introduction to Networking 
### Hosts as ending systems, running network apps 
- Connected with using communication links (fiber, copper, radio, WIFI, satellite, etcs) 
- Bandwidth

### "Nuts & bolts" view
- Protocols: like TCP, IP, HTTP, UDP, DNS, ARP, etcs
### Network of networks 
- Loosely hierarchical
- Public vs private networks
- Internet Service Provders(ISPS)
### Standards 
- RFC: Request for Comments
- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Forces
### "Services" view
- Communication infrastructure, enabling distributed applications
- Communication services, provided to applications, connectionless or connection-oriented

## What is a PROTOCL?
- Human protocls: A->B: "What's the time?" B->A: "12:00"
- Define the format, order of messages sent and recieved among network entities, and the actions taken on message transmission or receipt.
- All communication activity on the Internet is governed by Protocols


## Network Structure
### Network Edge: Hosts running apps, Clients and Servers
- End systems(hosts): running apps, source or destination of network data
- Client/Server model: a client asks for and gets services from an "always-on" server. Web browser/Web Server
- Peer-to-peer model: Minimal use of dedicated servers. Peers host files for other peers. 

## Connection-orientated Communication Services
- Goal: Reliable data transfer between end systems
- Requires handshaking before sending data
- Provides Reliability
- Example: TCP in Transport Layer

## Different services for different applications
- TCP: HTTP, FTP, Telnet(remote login), SMTP(email)
- UDP: DNS, Skype(VOIP), Streaming media, Zoom(Teleconferencing)

### Network Cores: Routers, Interconnected Networks, "Network of networks"
- A mesh of interconnected routers
- Circuit switching: Discrete paths, end-to-end resoures reserved for the connection, no sharing with other connections
- Network bandwidth is divided into pirces, allocated to connections, and idle if not used by the connection owner
- FDM, TDM

````markdown
TDM
 Freq   ｜｜｜｜｜｜｜
        ｜｜｜｜｜｜｜
        ｜｜｜｜｜｜｜
        TIme

FDM
Users use different freq
 Freq   -----------
        -----------
        -----------
        TIme
````

Either: Devide the available bdw / slots

Frequency is measured by Hz. 
Assuming pipe is thin, so only some number of parallel bits.
Additional frequency more bits, more channel less bits per time slot

or Users use full freqs for per time slot

example: 
How long does it take to send a file of 640000bits from A to B over a circuit-switched network?
Each link uses TDM with 24 slots
500 msec to build the end-to-end circit
All links with bandwith 1.536Mbps

TDM splits the transmission rate among all slots, A single-circuit transmission rate is 1.536Mbps/24 = 64Kbps
10 sec + 500ms = 10.5 seconds



## Packet switching: Discrete chunks of data, every packet uses the full bdw of a link (no TDM/FDM)
- Packet moved hop by hop, routed.
- \+ Connectionless/Stateless
- \+ No resource sharing
- \- Resource contention: Aggregate demand can exceed available resources in the intermediate routers
- \- Congestion: Packet wait in routers' queues, waiting to user the whole link
- \- Packet arrive from multiple sources
- \- Packet can be dropped if demnand is too high

## Statistical Multiplexing
- Packets go from different sources, to the same router
- packets arrive in random/statistical order

Pattern has to be determined by some means of statistical methods.

## Store-and-forward Model

- For a packet of L bits
- On a link of R bps throughput (bdw)
- Takes L/R seconds to transmit the packet (Transmission time)
- The entire packet (all the bits) must arrive at the router before it can be transmitted to next node.
- Example: 7.5Mb/1.5Mbps = 5 seconds

```markdown
Host A ---- R bps ----> Node B ----- Rbps ------> Node C ---- Rbps ---> Host B
All links are 1.5 Mbps
Send a 7.5 Mb file:
Time = 7.5Mb/1.5Mbps = 5 sec (ignoring propogation, queueing, setup time)
Why not 15 sec? Packet switching, we can see packet granularity helps!

If 5000 packets of each 1500 bits
Time at which the second packt reached the end: 1 msec after packet 1
Time to forward a packet in a link: 1500 bits/1.5 Mbps = 1 msec
Time at which the first packet reached the end: 3 msec
Totla time: 3 msec + 4999 * 1 msec = 5.002 sec: nice improvements!
```

## Packet vs circuit switching
- Allows more users
- Imagine a 1 Mbps link
- n users: Active 10% of the tie, using 100Kbps when active
- Max n for circuit switching: 10 users
- Max n for packet switching: 

With 40 users, the probability of > 10 being active is < 0.001
Calculate probability

## Is packet switching the answer?
- \+ Great for burst data
- \+ Resources are shared
- \+ Simpler: no circuit set-up / reservations

- \- More packets that cannot be queued and handles 
- - Packet delay and loss 
- - Must add protection (complexity) for reliable transmission and congestion control




<!-- ### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Lec 2 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

## Delay and Loss in Packet Switching Networks 
### Sources of delay/loss
- Before transmission, packets queue in router buffers
- Store process and forward once all the bits are received
- Packet arrival rate may exceed output capacity

### Delay types
- Processing Delay: Time spent in the router: check for bit errors(checksums), determine the output link(next hop)
- Queueing Delay: Each output link in a router stores packets in a queue(buffer), depends on the congestion level of the router and the transmission algorithms.
- Transmission Delay: T = L/R time to transmit packet, place all the packet bits in the link
- Propagation Delay: 2.8 x 10^8 m/s, bits travelling through a medium (fiber, wireless,..)

## Nodal delay
dproc + dqueue + dtrans + dprop => dnodal 
- why queueing delay depends on network congestions? depends on statistical multiplexing. (0~few ms) 

## Queuing delay 
L = packet length (bits/pkt)
R = link speed (bps)
λ = average packet arrival rate
Traffic intensity (ρ) = L x λ / R
- if ~ 0: average queueing delay is small
- =1: delayes become large, a small increase in traffic substantially increases the delay
- greater than 1: More packet arriving than can be processed, the average delay goes to infinity


## Packet loss
- queue preceding link in the router has a finite capacity
- When a packet arrives in a full queue, the packet is dropped
- A packet packet may be retransmitted by the previous node, by the source end system, not retransmited at all

## Real delays
- Tool: traceroute provides delay measurements for each hop in the path
- For all routers i in some path:
- Send 3 packets(probes) that will reach router i on the path roward the destination
- The router i will respond to the sender
- Measure transmission and reply interval
- Info: Intermediate router, 3 delay measurements, can have different routes if congested/lost

## Networks are complex! How to organize
- Many components, many layers
### What architecture should be used?
- Layered Network Architecture
- Set of layers, each of them: provides a service(defined in a protocol), specifies an interface for accessing the service
- User services of the layer direcly
## Network architecture defines all the layers and the design of protocols/interfaces for each layer

## Why layering? 
### Decompose the complex networking problem into managable pieces
- Monolithic non-layered architectures are costly, inflexible, and soon obsolete.
- Structured way to understand
- Protocol in each layer can be developed seperately from those in other layers
- Implementation in a layer can change wihtout affecting other layers, as long as the interface remains the same
- Details not required in lower layers
- Simplifies the design, implementation and testing

## Why not layering?
- Duplication of lower-layer functions, reliability at link + transport layer
- Information hiding affects performance, may require info from lower layers

# ISO OSI Reference Model
## ISO: International Standard Organization
## OSI: Open Systems Interconnection was a reference framwork to enable multi-vendor interconnection (interoperability)
- Provides a unified view of layers, services, and protocols in each layer
## Not well introduced, as TCP/IP pre-empted deployment of OSI protocols

## Application

## Presentation

## Session

## Transport
- End-to-end transfer of messages (i.e., segments)
- Port numbers enable the multiplexing of various apps
- Message segmentations and reassembly
- Connection setup, maintenance, and release

## Network
- Transport packets across links
- Scalable addressing: Hierarchically
- Routing protocol: determine best paths..
- Example: IPv4 & IPv6



## Data Link
- Transfer frames between 2 adjacent nodes (directly connected)
- A frame is a sequence of bits or blocks of information
- Inserts control, addressing, and error correction info
- Activation, maintenance, and deactivation of link connection
- Example: Ethernet, PPP, HDLC, Wi-Fi


## Physical
- Transfer bits across a link

This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

```c++
int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

```markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
```

Which displays:

1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;


    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();
    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %} -->
