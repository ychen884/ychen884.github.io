## ** Chapter 1: Overview of Cloud Computing ** <a name="topic-1"></a>
#### Definitions

##### Properties:
- Computing utility, always available, accessible through the networks
- Simplified interface
- Statistical multiplexing, sharing resources
- Economies of scale from consolidation, costs lower
- Capital costs converted to operating costs
- Rapid and easy variation of usage
- Appearance of infinite resources with small users
- Pay only for what you use
- Cost conservation: 1 unit for 1000 hours == 1000 units for 1 hour

##### Consolidation, sharing, elasticity
- CLT theory
- users with widely varying needs apply a considerably less variable load on a huge provider, allowing providers to do less overprovisioning. 
- - Because of CLT, it is predictable for the overall load which causes less overprovisioning.
- Users perceive exactly what they need all the time, if their needs are “small”(so the accessed resources are appearing as infinite)

##### SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
- SaaS: service as application (Salesforce)
- - consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage & minimum deployed applications configurations settings.
- PaaS: high-level programming model for cloud computer, Turing complete but resource management hidden. (Google AppEngine)
- - consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage but with control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
- IaaS:  low-level computing model for cloud computer (AWS)
- - The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications

##### XXX as a Service
- Data as a Service, Network as a Service, Communication as a Service(No hardware private VOIP switching), IT as a Service(IT providing services)..

##### Deployment models
```
public cloud: provider sells computing to unrelated consumers
private cloud: largely unrelated components and divisions as consumers
community cloud: providers and consumers are different organizations with strong shared concerns
Hybrid cloud: private plus public resources combined by same consumer. Better availability, overflow from private to public, load balancing to increase elasticity
```
##### Larry Ellison’s objection
- definition is including too much
<!-- ● E.g., timesharing: many users slice up a single big computer
○ Virtualize the hardware as protected processes with shared storage
○ Accumulate usage accounting for billing/cost-sharing
● E.g., client-server computing: program API for communication
○ Relieve clients from burden of operating, provisioning server
○ Set abstraction of server function at a natural/constrained level
● E.g., leasing companies – spread the cost over computer lifetime
○ Rates depend on commitment: 100% -> prime rate loan,
lower commitment to pay leads to high “interest” rates -->

##### Obstacles of cloud computing
- Privacy & security
- Privacy in the world tends to rely on regulation
- Utility issues
- Physical utilities tend to rely on regulation 
- High cost of networking combined with always remote
- Performance unpredictability & in situ development/debugging
- Software licensing – $/yr/CPU is not elastic and pay as you go


##### load balancing approach
##### 1. DNS load balancing
- DNS reorder the list for each client asking for translation of name
- PRO: easy to scale, unrelated to actual TCP/HTTP requests
- CON: new server may get less resources if scheduling more servers, dynamic changing is hard because it has to tell client for a binding(existing binding exists due to TTL, caching in network middleboxes). 


##### 2. Router distribute TCP connections 
- Router do the mapping: (client_ip+client_port) <-> (server_ip+server_port)
- - for SYN packets
- - not exposed to client about the ip address(like NAT)


- PRO: router doesn't have to think or remember too much, *it just selected the server with least connnection to schedule for the new connections.
- CON: traffic all go through the router(more difficult to scale), and decision takes time cuz it's for the entire session


#### 3. Router distribute individual quests embedded in connections
<!--  -->
- PRO: most dynamic
- CON: requires the most processing and state in the router, CPU load and memory goes up due to intelligent routing decisions.
#### Elasticit: How? Elasticity controller
- Elasticity controller to adjust load capability based on current load status
- Monitoring: resource usage, request sequence(patterns)
- Triggering: (simple conditions like thresholds), schedule, complex model based on monitored instances

#### Elasticity: Scale-out or Scale up
- Horizontal scaling: adding more instances (Common approach)
- Vertical scaling: Resizing the resources(bdw, cpu cores, memory) allocated to an existing instances, challenging(different OS.) More challenging.

#### Two-tier services
- web-database
- web server easy to be in cloud. At beginning, order-taking is not in cloud.
- Elasticity in IaaS: database scaling is more difficult with state(consistency)
- PassS, P=Web Service. Built-in elastic load balancing and scheduled actions for containers, persistent key-value store (datastore) & non-persistent memcache
for simple database tier, Users can instantiate Backends, user code can request (actuate) horizontal scaling, running traditional database services, whose scaling is still hard.

##### Load-balancing method affect how much statistics we can get. 
- Router-based load balancing: firewall, intrusion detection, accelerator
- scaling middleboxes: CPU intensive tasks. (OpenFlow, split flows)
- bdw allocation by sw/rt

##### Service parallelization: Load Balancer
- aws cloud watch
- Load balancer is not necessarily elastic

##### Scalable relational database
- Separate data at rest(distributed pay-for-use storage (HDFS)) from ongoing or recent access & mutation
- Recent access & mutation servers are elastic (called Owning Transaction Managers)
- Partitioned but all transactions restricted to one partition: transactions block on locks and bottleneck performance scaling
- Fault-tolerance of Elastic controller.  Controller itself, reliability provided by replication. Can re-assigns partitions while server is down/start up.

##### ElasTraS architecture scales OTM machines
- Transactions are limited to interacting with data from only one partition to avoid the complexity of distributed transactions.
- TODO

Cloud computing: what brings it? large capital outlays, overprovisioning/underprovisioning...

Definition: Refers to both the applications as services over the internet and hardware and systems software in the data center that provide those services. The services themselves: SaaS. Services being sold is utility computing. Cloud computing = SaaS + utility computing. It has to be large enough to be called cloud. Hardware provisioning/pricing: 1. inifinite computing resources available on demand; 3. elimination of an up-front commitment by cloud users, add resources when needed; 4. pay for use of computing resources temporarily. *Construction and operaition of extremely large-scale, commodify-computer data centers at low-cost locations was the key necessary enabler of cloud computing. It could offer services below the costs of a medium-sized data center and make profits.

Utility Computing classes: EC2 with low level control but less automatic scalability and failover(application may need to control the replication...). Google AppEngine(domain specific platforms) on the other hand. Azure is in between. 

Economics: Favor cloud computing over conventional: 1. demand of services changes over time 2. demand is unknown
usage based pricing economically benefits the buyer. 
Elasticity helps reduce the costs. Underprovisioning has a cost that is difficult to measure: the users may never come back. Scale-up elasticity is an operational requirement, and scale-down elasticity allowed the steady state expenditure to more closely match the steady-state workload. 


Obstacles for Cloud computing:

1-3(adoption):
1. Business Continuity and Service Availability (hard to ensure availability, single failure still exists for a service provider)
2. Data Lock-In (public+private sharing by sharing API)
3. Data Confidentiality/Auditability: from other user/provider 

4-8(growth):
4. Data Transfer Bottlenecks： Applications continue to become more data-intensive
5. Performance Unpredictability： I/O interference between virtual machines, concerns scheduling of virtual machines for some classes of batch processing programs, specifically for highperformance computing
6.Scalable Storage
7. Bugs in Large Scale Distributed Systems: bugs cannot be reproduced in smaller configurations
8. Scaling Quickly

9-10(policy and business):
9. Reputation Fate Sharing, legal liability(customer responsible->unexpected down)
10. Software Licensing



Opportunities: 
- improve architectures and operating systems to efficiently virtualize interrupts and I/O channels
- flash memory will decrease I/O interference.
- offer something like “gang scheduling” for cloud computing
- create a storage system that would not only meet existing programmer expectations,but combine them with the cloud advantages of scaling arbitrarily up and down on demand. 
- reliance on virtual machines in cloud computing.(7)
- automatically scale quickly up and down in response to load in order to save money
- create reputation-guarding services similar to the “trusted email” services 
```


- Referring to NISTdef2011
```
Characteristics:
- On-demand self-service
- Broad network access
- Rapid elasticity
- Resource pooling (multi-tenant)
```

- Dynamically Scaling Applications in the Cloud
```
vertical scaling is hard: rebooting..
load balancers need to support

Server scalability: a per-tier controller, a single controller for the whole application (for all tiers)
How and When to Scale: Feeding Controller with Rules and Policies
- adding load balancers
- LB scalability requires the total time taken to forward each request to the corresponding server to be negligible for small loads and should grow no faster than O(p) 
-  CPU-intensive web app: a LB to split computation among many instances.
-  network intensive: CPU-powerful standalone instance to maximize throughput
-  more network intensive applications, it may be necessary to use DNS load balancing

Scaling the network:
- Virtualization: VLAN(L2)
-  periodically measure actual network usage per application use other applications’ - increase the utilization of the network by virtually “slicing”: “network as a service”
- statistical multiplexing


Scaling the platform:
PaaS cloud platforms
- Container Scalability: execution environment for user applications.scalability of the container layer is crucial as it must efficiently manage and distribute resources to meet the demands of potentially numerous applications running concurrently.

Multitenant containers and Isolation: requires strong isolation to prevent security issues
Individual Containers per User: simplifies isolation but requires effective management of numerous containers.
Horizontal Scaling via Container Replication: achieved through automatic scaling in IaaS systems or by inherent capabilities of the platform itself
Components should ideally be stateless to cope with the dynamic nature of container instantiation and disposal, support for stateful components is also necessary, requiring sophisticated load balancing (LB) and container management to handle session data.(soft state replication, distributed caching systems)

- Database Scalability: for example, implementing horizontal scaling strategies, such as replicating the database across multiple nodes to handle increased load and ensure data availability. (demands on PaaS platforms can often surpass the capacity of any single machine)
NoSQL Databases: These databases provide high scalability and availability, fitting well in cloud environments with high demand. However, they offer eventual consistency rather than immediate consistency, leading to limitations in transaction support and SQL functionalities.
Replication Mechanisms: In-core Solutions, Middleware Solutions

Ideal Elastic Cloud: scale through VM or container replication, reconfiguration, and dynamic load balancing, possibly using DNS for the latter. allow dynamic allocation of network resources. 
Ideal PaaS Platform Features: capable of instantiating or releasing instances of user components based on demand changes and distributing the load transparently among them. Implementing session concepts and supporting transparent data replication are essential. Access to traditional relational databases with ACID transaction support is crucial. However, the system must address the increased latency due to consistency maintenance across replicas, especially under high demand.
```
-  Infrastructure-as-Code tools provide a high-level software interface (e.g., Python / Ruby or JSON / YAML) that allows developers to specify their infrastructure requirements, software dependencies, and the process for building the infrastructure and deploying it to the cloud

## ** Chapter 2: Building a CMU Cloud ** <a name="topic-2"></a>
#### Model
- aim for less costs

```
Client ->
App
OS
Instance(s)
--------------------
Hypervisor (shared)
Building Blocks
Usage Monitor
Hardware (shared)
(shared Amazon EC2)

```
- Problem: used mostly during ddl? 2 methods, renting..
- Build a cloud
```
1. user would rent, so provisioner(resources,monitoring,... -> assignment of users to machines)
- Bin-packing, NP-hard. Can do with assumptions.. -> less complexity
- Migration, also costs
2. Scheduler: which user jobs/processes to run: Prioritization(pay more), Oversubscription, Workload constraints
3. Encapsulation: compute, storage, networking and data
4. Virtualization
5. Fault tolerance: 
    why scale of data center matters? Economy of scale, cost of operations
    state replication, logging, storage replic

Storage services - Scalable, fault tolerant
Tools - Programming models, frameworks
Automation - Reactive systems & elastic scaling

Elastic scaling - based on monitoring and diagnosis
traditional: provision for peaks

```


- Cloud users & Services
- - App user: availability, performance, no interfaces exposed by cloud service provider (app provider did that)
- - Application Deployment User: Dashboard, management interfaces exposed
- - Admin: Management...

- Orchestration: automatic deployment for user

##### OpenStack
- independent parts,6 core services
- communicate through public and well-defined APIs
- Identity -> Dashboard -> Compute(?)/Network -> Image -> Object storage(get the image for VM) -> Block Storage(volume) -> initiate VM
- Distributed storage to accelerate image initialization takes Azure many years to fix

- Virtual Infrastructure Management in Private and Hybrid Clouds
```
Virtual Infrastructure (VI) management in the context of private/hybrid cloud environments: Uniform Resource View, Full Lifecycle Management of VMs, Configurable Resource Allocation Policies, Adaptability to Changing Resource Needs. provides primitives to schedule and manage VMs across multiple physical hosts


OpenNebula: This is a VI manager that allows organizations to deploy and manage VMs, either individually or in groups. It automates the VM setup process (including preparing disk images and setting up networking) and is compatible with various virtualization layers (Xen, KVM, VMware) and external clouds (EC2, ElasticHosts).

Haizea: This acts as a lease manager and can serve as a scheduling backend for OpenNebula. It introduces leasing capabilities not present in other cloud systems, such as advance reservations and resource preemption, which are particularly valuable for private cloud environments.



Traditional VI Management Tools: lack certain features necessary for building IaaS clouds, such as public cloud-like interfaces and the ability to deploy VMs on external clouds.
Cloud toolkits can help transform existing infrastructure into an IaaS cloud with cloudlike interfaces. VI management capabilities are not as robust.
    -: Gap: There's a noticeable gap between cloud management and VI management. Cloud toolkits attempt to cover both areas but often fall short in delivering comprehensive VI management functionalities. Integrating cloud management solutions with VI managers is complex due to the lack of open, standard interfaces and certain key features in existing VI managers.
    
    OpenNebula: overcome these challenges, Scaling to external clouds. A flexible and open architecture for easy extension and integration with other software. A variety of placement policies and support for scheduling, deploying, and configuring groups of VMs.
    
    Integration of Haizea with OpenNebula: work as a scheduler for OpenNebula, This integration allows OpenNebula to offer resource leases as a fundamental provisioning abstraction, and Haizea to operate with real hardware through OpenNebula. This combination provides advanced features like advance reservation of capacity, which is not offered by other VI managers.

    The integration is particularly beneficial for private clouds with limited resources, enabling sophisticated VM placement strategies that support queues, priorities, and advance reservations (ARs).

OpenNebula: 
core:  image and storage technologies for preparing disk images for VMs, network fabric (such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP] servers, firewalls, or switches) for providing VMs with a virtual network environment, hypervisors for creating and controlling VMs. Performs operations through pluggable drivers. 
A separate scheduler component makes VM placement decisions.
Management interfaces: libvirt API intergrate within other data center management tools, cloud interface exposed to external users.
Cloud drivers to interface with external clouds

The Haizea Lease Manager: Haizea is an open source resource lease manager and can act as a VM scheduler for OpenNebula.
Advance Reservation (AR) Leases: Resources are guaranteed to be available at a specific future time. This is beneficial for scenarios requiring resource certainty.
Best-Effort Leases: Resources are provisioned as soon as possible, with requests queued if immediate provisioning isn't possible.
Immediate Leases: Resources are provided immediately upon request or not at all, suitable for urgent needs without flexibility.
    
Haizea addresses the challenge of resource underutilization, often a downside of AR, by leveraging VMs. It allows for efficient support of ARs through resource preemption - suspending lower-priority VMs to free up resources for higher-priority needs and resuming them later.
It uses optimizations such as reusing disk images across leases to minimize the impact of preparation overhead and schedules runtime overheads (like suspending, resuming, and migrating VMs) efficiently.
Scheduling is based on a resource slot table, representing all physical nodes managed by Haizea over time.
Best-effort leases are managed using a first-come-first-serve queue with backfilling, optimizing queue-based systems.
AR leases utilize a greedy algorithm for selecting physical resources to minimize preemptions.

There are ongoing efforts to extend OpenNebula's capabilities, including the implementation of the libvirt interface, VM consolidation schedulers for minimizing energy consumption, and tools for service elasticity management, VM placement, public cloud interface support, and policy-driven dynamic placement optimization.

Haizea shows that VM-based approaches with suspend/resume capabilities can address utilization issues typically associated with advance reservation (AR) use.
