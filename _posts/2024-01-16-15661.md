<!-- inductive definition -> inference rules -->
<!-- 

If we prove the top is true, then the bottom form is true.

set of natural numbers:

------- N0
nat(0)

nat(n)
------ N1
nat(n+1)

Set of pair of numbers (x,y) that x <= y, both integers:

------   leq0
leq(0,0)

leq(n,m)
------   leq1
leq(n+1,m+1)

leq(n,m)
------   leq2
leq(n,m+1)


Prove leq(3,4) bing true

leq(0,0)
------
leq(1,1)
------
leq(2,2)
------
leq(3,3)
------   leq2
leq(3,4)


loops can happen but rule designers should make it safe 

Mode:

leq(input, output)
use inference rules to query with an input for an output.
add(n1, n2, n3)
=> n1 + n2 = n3


----------- A1
add(0,n,n)

add(m,n,k)
----------- A2
add(m+1,n,k+1)


what if add(1,1,k)? show k=2?

k = 2
----------- A1
add(0,1,k-1)
----------- A2
add(1,1,k)


use leq rules to create a set:
i, k <= 2
s0: empty set
s1: {(0,0)}
s2: {(1,1),(0,1),(0,0)}
s3: {(2,2),(1,2)...}

3. [Chapter 2: Register Allocation](#topic-2)



## **Chapter 1: Overview of Compiler Design ** <a name="topic-1"></a>



### What makes a good Compiler: metrics
- correctness
- code quality: compiled code runs fast
- efficiency: compilation runs fast
- usability: provides errors/warnings, ...

### Compiler Design
- structure compilers
- applied alg & data structures
- focus on sequential imperative programming languages 
- - not functional, parallel, distributed, OOP...
- code generation and optimization

### Organizing a compiler
#### Front
- split work into different phases
- Lexical analysis -> Token stream
- Parsing -> Abstract syntax tree (mark body of while loop...)
- Sementic analysis (type check, variable initialization)

#### Middle
- IR(intermediate representation) Generation -> Intermediate representations
- Optimize (most challenging)

#### Back
- Instruction selection -> Abstract assembly
- Register allocation -> ASM
Middle and Back has unclear distinctions

[Back to Blog Chapters](#blog-chapters)
## **Chapter 1.1: Instruction Selection ** <a name="topic-1.1"></a>
- Compiler phase
- IR tree -> abstract assembly

Example: 
```
x = 5
return x+x+x*2

->>> Instruction selection
x = 5
temp1 = x + x 
temp2 = x * 2
ret_reg = t1 + t2
ret
```
##### IR tree (more expressions, statements..)
```
Programs p ::= s1,...sn (sequence of statements)
statements s ::= x = e 
                return e

Expressions:
e ::= c int const
      x variable
      e1 ⊕ e2 binary OP (nested)
      ⊕ ::= +1 * 1 / 1 ...
```

##### Abstract Assembly (flat)
```
Program: p ::= i1, ... in (instructions)
Instructions i::= d <- s move
                = d <- s1 ⊕ s2 bin op (sometimes one of the source works as dst)
                = ret return
Operands:
    d,s ::= r register (usually* finite numbers as defined)
          = c int const
          = t temps (variables)
          = x var

```

##### Translations Expr
```
translate(e1 ⊕ e2) = translate(e1); translate(e2);
res1 ⊕ res2?
Better: 
trans(d,e): seq of instructions that stores value of e in destination d. 


e           trans(d,e)
x           d <- x
c           d <- c
e1 ⊕ e2     trans(t1, e1), trans(t2, e2), d<-t1⊕t2, (t1 and t2 are fresh temps)


```

##### Translate statements
```
trans'(s): seq of instru that inlements s
s           trans'(s)
x = e       trans(x,e)
return e    trans(ret,e) return (ret: return register)
```
##### Example
```
IR prog: 
z = (x + 1) * (y * 4)
return z

trans'(p) 
= trans'(z = (x + 1) * (y * 4)), trans'(return z)
= trans(z,(x + 1) * (y * 4)),trans(ret, z), return
= trans(t1,x+1), trans(t2,y * 4), z<- t1 * t2, ret<-z, return
= t3 <- x, t4 <- 1, t1 <- t3 + t4, t5 <- y, t6 <- 4, t2 <- t5 * t6, z <- t1*t2, ret<-z, return
Optimize? directly use x and y instead of moving them to temps

```
##### How to improve
1. Add special cases: for example c ⊕ e2
2. Optimization pass after the first pass of translation (common approach)
3. Different translation

##### Constant propagation
- goal: eliminate move t <- c, p by replacing t with c in p
- But: stop replacing t if it's written again
```
Example: 
t <- 4
x <- t+1   ---> x <- 4+1 
t <- 5
ret <- t   --NO--> ret <- 4
return 
```

##### Copy propagation
- goal: elim move d <- t,p by replacing d with t in p, But: step replacing if d is written or if t is written

```


t <- 5+1
d <- t 
x <- d+1 ----> x <- t+1
t <- 5+2
ret <- d+1 ---No---> ret <- t + 1
ret
```

##### Static Single Assignment Form 
```
- every temp is assigned at most once
- don't have to check "writes" but can replace all occurances in propagations
- Conversion to SSA -> user version nums

t <- 5+1
d <- t 
x <- d+1 ----> x <- t+1
t <- 5+2
ret <- d+1 ----No---> ret <- t + 1
ret

----->>

t0 <- 5+1
d0 <- t0
x0 <- d0+1
t1 <- 5+2
...
```

## **Chapter 2: Register Allocation ** <a name="topic-2"></a>
- Goal: assign registers and stack locations to temps
##### X86-64: 16 registers, no temps
- stack locations, when keeping track of more variables than registers
##### Strategy
1. Store all temps on the stack (CON: inefficient, still need registers for efficiency)


```
IR trees(simplified syntax tree) 
--> Instruction selection --> ASM 
--> reg alloc --> ASM
--> x86 asm


Example: 
d <- s1 ⊕ s2
-> reg alloc

rlld <- exd * 4(rsp)
```
##### Difficulty: x86 has 15 gen purpose registers
- Goal: assign each variable a register
- may have to use stack locations and clever use of registers for variables

##### Interference:
```
x <- 14
y <- 15 
z <- x+y

x <- 14
y <- 15 + x 
ret <- 4+y
ret
if x is not used again, we can use overwrite the register for y
```

##### Rigth IR for reg alloc? 
##### 3 addr abs asm
```
d <- s1 + s2
d <- s1 / s2
...
```
##### 2 addr abs asm
```
d <- s1
d <- d + s2

d <- s1
d <- d / s2
...

```

##### abstract x86
```
MOVL S1,d
ADDL S2,d
...
IDIVL
edx:eax / s2 -> eax

MOVL s1, %eax
CLTD (sign-extends eax into edx:eax.)
----
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17170388/trying-to-understand-the-assembly-instruction-cltd-on-x86
What this means in practice is that edx is filled with the most significant bit of eax (the sign bit). For example, if eax is 0x7F000000 edx would become 0x00000000 after cdq. And if eax is 0x80000000 edx would become 0xFFFFFFFF.
----
IDIVL s2 (edx:eax / s2)
MOVL %eax, d

```
##### Reg Alloc at 3-Addr Assem
- leave one register unassigned for later conversion (r11d)

```
For example

d <- s1 ⊕ s2
--> 
MOVL s1, %r11d
ADDL s2, %r11d
MOVL %r11d, d
(one of them has to be a register
this will always work, but may not be the optimzied solution)

```

##### Reg Alloc at 2-Addr Assem
```
For example

d <- s1 + s2
--> 
d <- s1
d <- s2 + d
```

##### How to allocate registers? 
- Goal: minimize spilling to the stack
- One method: graph-based, greedy register allocation
1. Build interference graph
```
Vertices are registers and temps
Edges indicate interference (need diff registers)

Example: 
t1  -- t2 -- t3 -- eax
        |           |
         -----------

Complexity pf deciding if two temps interfere? Undecidable
Why? Reduction to the halting problem
x <- 5
y <- 6
complex code (doesn't use x and y)
ret<- x + y
return

x and y interfere iff complex code terminates


Approximate Interference with liveness
Liveness: temp t is live at line l if t might be used in the 
following computation

For L1: work backwards
temp t is live at l if either of them is valid:
- t is read at l
- t is live at l+1 and not written at line l

Example: 
x1 <- 1            -
x2 <- 1           x1
x3 <- x1 + x2     x2,x1
x4 <- x3 + x2     x3,x2
x5 <- x4 + x3     x3,x4
ret <- x5         x5
return ret        ret register

life range of t1: 2-3
life range of x2: 3-4
..


t1 <- 1     -
t1 <- t1+1  t1
t2 <- t1    t1

Construct interf graph:
Option 1: Add edge between t1 and t2 if they have overlapping live ranges
Option 2: rule 1: For every instruction d <- s1 ⊕ s2
                        add an edge {d,t} if t is  live at the next instruction
          rule 2: For every move d <- s, add an edge {d,t} 
                  that t not in {s,d}, and is live at the next instruction


```



2. Find coloring with as few colors as possible: Adjacent vertices have different colors
```
Given: Graph G = (V,E) and k colors
Question: Is there a coloring of V with k colors such that adjacent verticies have different colors
Complexity: NP complete for k >= 3 

What folllows for reg allocation? 

For a Turing-comp lang
It's undecidable for a prog if there's an equiv prog that uses k registers (and no tem)

```

3. Assign colors to registers and stack locations
```
Greedy graph coloring: get a minimal coloring for most programs

Assume colors are number 1,2,3...

Let N(v) be the nbs of v
Input: G(V,E) and ordering V=v1,...,vn
Output: Coloring of V: col:V->{1,..k}

- Order matters

x5 

x4-x3-x2-x1

Order 1: x5,x4,x3,x2,x1,ret

Order 2: x1,x4,x3,x2,x5,ret


```
##### Th: There exists an ordering that produces an optimal coloring
```
How to find optimal ordering for chordal graphs?

Def: A graph is chordal if every cycle with >= 4 vertices has a chord 
(edge between two verticies in the cycle that is not in the cycle)

Example

a - b
|   |
c - d
not chordal

a - b
| / |
c - d
chordal

a - b
| x |
c - d
chordal


Intuition: how to get long cycle w/o chord?
a over lap with b and c
we want d to be not overlapping with a


```
#####  Maximum cardinality search
```
Input: G, Op: ordering of v
for each vertex in V, set wt(v) <- 0

For all v ∈ V set wt(v) ← 0
Let W ← V
For i ← 1 to n do
      Let v be a node of maximal weight in W
      Set vi ← v
      For all u ∈ W ∩ N(v) set wt(u) ← wt(u) + 1
      Set W ← W \ {v}


MCS Ordering returns: simplicial elimination ordering if G is chordal
Def: v is simplicial in G in N(v) is a clique
A simplicial vertex is one whose neighbors form a clique: every two neighbors are adjacent. 


Def: A simpl elim ordering is an ord v1, ... vn st vi is simplicial in
Gv1,..vi <- subgraph induced by v1, .. vi (picked)
```

##### Theorem 1: The graph is chordal iff it has an simplicial elim ordering

```
Proof..
```
##### Theorem 2: The greedy coloring alg finds an opt coloring if run with a simpl elim ordering
```
Proof: Let k be the number of colors used
Observations: 
1. k <= max|Ni(vi)| + 1
2. #min colors >= max|Ni(vi)| + 1
```

##### -> Theorem: MCS returns a sompl elem ordering iff G is chordal 



4. Spill: assign remaining colors to stack loc.

```
strategies: 
1. number of uses of temps in code, higher use freq get the registers
2. incorp loop nestings
3. highest colors (high color may be used in less time, approx for 1)

```


#### Summary
1. Build the interference graph (different ways)
2. Order the vertices with MCS
3. Color with greedy alg
4. Spill if # colors > 13

#### Liveness analysis & interence rules
```
live(l,x) ~ x i live at line l
d != u
l: d <- x ⊕ y live(l+1, u)
--------------------------
      live(l, u)


l: d<- x ⊕ y
------------------
    live(l, x)
    live(l, y)

l: return
------------------
   live(l, ret)


l: x <- c
live(l+1, u), x!=u
-------------------
      live(l,u)

l: x<-y, u!=x
live(l+1, u)
--------------
live(l,u)


l:x<-y
-------
live(l,y)

Using derivation tree to prove if x live at line l

```

##### General Saturation Alg
```
Can be used for all predicates
1: start with empty set of facts <- derived predicates
2: pick arg (here: l and t) and a rule with live(l,t) in the conclusion
so that the premises are already facts
3: Repeat until no facts can be derived

Will always stop
```


##### Refactoring liveness rules
```
use(l,x)
---------
live(l,x)

*: l' is a possible succesor
live(l'x) succ(l,l') ~def(l,x) 
---------------------------------
      live(l,x)

```

##### Need to define:
```
use(l,x) ~ x is used at l 
def(l,x) ~ x is def at l
succ(l,l') ~ l' can be a succ of l
```

##### Example 
```
l: d <- x ⊕ y
-------------
use(l,x)
use(l,y)
def(l,d)
succ(l,l+1)
```


##### Adding loops and conditionals:
```
i = l: d <- x ⊕ y
.
.
.
l: goto l' (uncond jump)
l: if(x?c) then lt then lt else lf(cond jump)

New rules:

l: goto l'
-----------
succ(l,l')

l: if(x'c) then lt
else lf
-------------------
succ(l,lt)
succ(l,lf)
use(l,x)


Keep doing iterations until we cannot add more new to the liveness sets
pass 1, pass 2, ...

```

##### Interference graph
```
1. Overlapping live ranges

live(l,x) live(l,y)
-------------------
inter(x,y)

But doesn't work in the presence of that code dead code

Example: 
a <- 1
b <- 2
ret <- a
return
```

2. Assignment based
More sparse
```
l: x <- y ⊕ z live(l+1, u), u!=x
---------------------------------
inter(x,u)

l:x<-y, y!=u
live(l+1, u) x!=u
------------------
inter(x,u)

l: x<-c, u!=x
live(l+1, u)
--------------
inter(x,u)
```

#### Elaboration
##### Goal: minimal repr and clear of progr
1. remove syntactic sugar
2. make scope explicit


```
Parsing -> Parse tree -> elaboration -> AST(<-Semantic analysis)

Example: 
turn for lops into while loops

for(int x=4, x<8128, x++){
      y = y+x
}
------> elab
use declaration(x,int,s)
{int x=4; while(x<8128)..}
decl(x, int, while(x<8218){..})



```
