### Course Evaluation (Final grade: N/A)
I will add my course evaluation at the end of this semester.
### Paper reviews
I will upload my paper reviews here later.

## **Blog Chapters**
1. [Chapter 1: Overview of Compiler Design](#topic-1)
2. [Chapter 1.1: Instruction Selection](#topic-1.1)
3. [Chapter 1.2: ](#topic-1.2)



## **Chapter 1: Overview of Compiler Design ** <a name="topic-1"></a>



### What makes a good Compiler: metrics
- correctness
- code quality: compiled code runs fast
- efficiency: compilation runs fast
- usability: provides errors/warnings, ...

### Compiler Design
- structure compilers
- applied alg & data structures
- focus on sequential imperative programming languages 
- - not functional, parallel, distributed, OOP...
- code generation and optimization

### Organizing a compiler
#### Front
- split work into different phases
- Lexical analysis -> Token stream
- Parsing -> Abstract syntax tree (mark body of while loop...)
- Sementic analysis (type check, variable initialization)

#### Middle
- IR Generation -> Intermediate representations
- Optimize (most challenging)

#### Back
- Instruction selection -> Abstract assembly
- Register allocation -> ASM
Middle and Back has unclear distinctions

## **Chapter 1.1: Instruction Selection ** <a name="topic-1.1"></a>
- Compiler phase
- IR tree -> abstract assembly

Example: 
```
x = 5
return x+x+x*2

->>> Instruction selection
x = 5
temp1 = x + x 
temp2 = x * 2
ret_reg = t1 + t2
ret
```
- IR tree
```
Programs p ::= s1,...sn (sequence of statements)
statemetss s ::= x = e 
                return e

Expressions:
e ::= c int const
      x variable
      e1 ⊕ e2 binary OP
      ⊕ ::= +1 * 1 / 1 ...
```

- Abstract Assembly
```
Program: p ::= i1, ... in (instructions)
Instructions i::= d <- s move
                = s <- s1 ⊕ s2 bin op
                ret return
Operands:
    d,s ::= r register
          = c int const
          = t temps

```
