### Reference Book
#### Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Systems, by Ross J. Anderson

### What is security?

### Overview of Topics
- Foundations & crypto
- Access Control
- Network and web sec
- Software sec
- crypto app
- Human and socio-eco factors

<!-- ### Grade
- In-class participation polls - 5
- Offline participation activities - 5
- Homework assignments - 50
- Midterm - 20
- Final - 20 -->
<!-- 
### Homework
- Five grace days for the entire semester
- Earn one more grace day if you submit 24 hours earlier
- If keeping 5+ until the semester: special group activity with instructor & TA -->

#### Secrecy, privacy, and confidentiality
- Privacy: keeping personal information secret
- Confidentiality: obligation to preserve someone else's information secret
- Secrecy: effect of mechanisms used to limit the number of principles who can access information

#### Data integrity
- Protect message contents
#### Identification
- Identify oneself to the system
- Can by pseudonymous
#### Anonymity
- Alice decided to use Tor to browse websites anonymously
#### Authentication
- Authenticate the letter I received is from X
#### Non-repudiation
- Assurance that someone cannot deny something

#### Authorization, certification, access control. revocatio, witnessing
- Witnessing: verifying the creation or existence of information by an entity other than creator.
- Revocation: Retraction of certification or authorization


#### Freshness & AGE
- Freshness: proof that an event occurred after a given point in time
- Age: Proof that an event occurred before a given point in time

#### Mechanisms to achieve freshness and age
- Timestamp

#### Availability


### Security analysis
- Consider computer systems at the doctor's office
- Target system? Enumerate assets & value, Operating Value, Replacement cost
- Adversaries? 
- Security requirements? 
- Effective Security Approach? 


### Approaches to security
- Social norms: socially unacceptable for some behaviors
- Legal enforcement: laws
- Economics: attack is too costly

### Technological approaches
- Keep bad people at bay
- Strong lines of defense: cryptography, firewall, ...
- Redundancy: Availability, multiple paths
- Detection: can be used as a feed to legal system
- Preemptive strike: ptp file sharing network poisoning
- Recovery: Backups


### Security Engineering
- Practice is important!


## Threat Model
#### STRIDE - different types of attacks
#### Security Properties


#### Example - security of ATM
```
People --------card info--------> Bank

Create PIN:
1. PIN verification key to get a natural PIN from an acct number (using like DES)
2. The user's selected pin is combined with the natrual pin to get the PIN offset
3. PIN offset is stored on the bank side
4. Without the pin verification key, the attacker wouldn't get the natural pin

PIN verification key + Account number
               |
               V
            Natural PIN      User's pin
                |               |
                -----------------
                        |
                        V
                    PIN offset


Verify PIN:
1. Re-compute Pin offset using acct number and user's pin
2. Compare it with the stored one

Do we send user's pin through the network? NO

Enc(Pin enc key, pin) ----> Enc(Pin enc key, pin)
Bank then can decrypt to get the actual pin, and compute

Terminal or hardware is trusted, with its own key.
Working keys to allow transactions with foreign banks
Zone keys

It still fails... (Ross Anderson, 1993)

Security by obsecurity not correct
(reliance on secrecy as the main method of providing security to a system or component, specifically in security engineering, whether on design or implementation.)

Policies are important!
- In the US, custormer bears almost no responsibility in the charges incurred


Insider Attacks
Backer's ability to issue a 2nd card
- Could even conceal withdrawals in some cases

Outsider attacks
- Postal interception of cards and PINs
- Replay attacks
- Test transactions
- False terminals
- Fake slots
- Wireless camera


Guessable PINs
Complex fraud

Focused on what could possibly go wrong
• Relatively complex key system to ensure secrecy
• Should have focused on what was likely to go wrong
• Human error rendering cryptosystem useless 
• Should consider both human and tech. factors

<!-- This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

```c++
int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

```markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
```

Which displays:

1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %} -->
