## Reference Book
### Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Systems, by Ross J. Anderson

## What is security

## Overview
- Foundations & crypto
- Access Control
- Network and web sec
- Software sec
- crypto app
- Human and socio-eco factors

<!-- ## Grade
- In-class participation polls - 5
- Offline participation activities - 5
- Homework assignments - 50
- Midterm - 20
- Final - 20 -->
<!-- 
## Homework
- Five grace days for the entire semester
- Earn one more grace day if you submit 24 hours earlier
- If keeping 5+ until the semester: special group activity with instructor & TA -->

## Secrecy, privacy, and confidentiality
- Privacy: keeping personal information secret
- Confidentiality: obligation to preserve someone else's information secret
- Secrecy: effect of mechanisms used to limit the number of principles who can access information

## Data integrity
- Protect message contents
## Identification
- Identify oneself to the system
- can by pseudonymous
## Anonymity
- Alice decided to use Tor to browse websites anonymously
## Authentication
- Authenticate the letter I received is from X
## Non-repudiation
- Assurance that someone cannot deny something

## Authorization, certification, access control. revocatio, witnessing
- Witnessing: verifying the creation or existence of information by an entity other than creator.
- Revocation: Retraction of certification or authorization


## Freshness & AGE
- Freshness: proof that an event occurred after a given point in time
- Age: Proof that an event occurred before a given point in time

## Mechanisms to achieve freshness and age
- timestamp

## Availability


<!-- This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

```c++
int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

```markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
```

Which displays:

1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %} -->
