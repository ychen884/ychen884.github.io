### Course Evaluation (Final grade: A)
This course is structured for those who have minimal or some previous experience in computer security. It covers a broad spectrum of topics and also delves deeply into each area. The exams present a considerable challenge, and the lab requires effort, depending on the student's prior knowledge in security. Despite having studied information security and software security during my undergraduate studies, I found the labs in this course particularly engaging. Some topics, like cryptocurrency, privacy, and security management, were especially intriguing and somewhat new to me, adding a fresh perspective to my learning experience.
