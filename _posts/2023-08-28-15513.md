[Back to Blog Chapters](#blog-chapters)


### Binary Representation
- Operations represented by bits
- Simple numbers

### Hexadecimal and Octal
- Writing binary takes too much digits
- Dense representation
- 00 to FF
- 0 to 9; A to F
- C language: prefix using 0x to represent hexdecimal
- Formal convention

# Bits, Bytes, and Integers
- Boolean Algebra
- Operate on Bit Vectors: And, Or, Not, Xor 




```markdown
Examples:

- ~0x41 -> 0xBE
- - 01000001 -> 10111110 -> 0xBE
- ~0x00 -> 0xFF
- 0x69 & 0x55 -> 0x41
- 0x69 | 0x55 -> 0x7D


&, |, ^, ~ in C


    0110 1001
&   0101 0101
------------------
    0100 0001


    0110 1001
|   0101 0101
------------------
    0111 1101
```

- Contrast Bit-level operators: **&&, \|\| and !** in C


```markdown
0 is false, non-zero as true
always return 0 or 1 
Early termination

Example:
!0x41 -> 0x0
0x69||0x55 -> 0x01
p && *p (avoid null pointer access)

```
- Shift Operations


```markdown
Left Shift x << y
Fill with 0's on right
Right Shift x >> y
- Logical shift
Fill with 0's on the left
- Arithmetic shift
Relicate most significant bit on left
- Undefined Behavior
Shift amound < 0 or > word size - 1

- How does compiler decide? 
```


- Integer values

```markdown
What happens if we add 1 to 7 for three bits representation?
- overflow, modulus arithmetic 

- Unisigned and Non-negative Integers
- Negative numbers? First bit as signed bit 
    - 0 represent 0 
    - can 0 equal negative 0? 
    - we want -1 + 1 eq 0
- Trick
    1 is 1
    -1 + 1 = 0
    001 + 111 = 1000 -> zero by overflow
    110 + 010 = 1000 (2+(-2)) = 0
    -2 + 5 =  1011 = 011; just bits!

- Finding -x the easy way
    Flip all the bits, and add 1
    -x = ~x + 1
    (two's complement)

- C does not mandate using two's complement
    But most machines do, and we will assume so

- Numeric Ranges:
    0 ~ 2^w - 1
    -2^w-1 ~ 2^w-1 -1 

- Signed and Unisgned in C
    int tx, ty;
    unsigned ux, uy;
    -1 compared to unisgned 0? 
    negative one is greater! Implicitely cast things to unsigned.
    
    if 2147483648U is converted as signed, converted to negative

- Signed Extension:
    01010 -> 001010
    11010 -> 111010
    - sign extension for signed, zeros added for unsigned

- Truncation:
    Converting to fewer number of bits
    - Just truncating bits, may cause value changes
    11010 -> 1010 (no sign change)
    01010 -> 1010 (sign change)
    
- Unsigned Additon
    Straight forward, add bits with carry, discard overflowed bit
    (can get the bit back, but in default in C it is discarded)

    One overflow

- Two's complement Addition
    Same behavior, if convert to unsigned, add together and then convert back to signed

    two overflows: negative & postive overflows


- To maintain the exact results
    Some arbitrary precision packages

- Power of 2 same as shifting
    let compiler do it

```
#### Byte Ordering
- Why convention Big Endian or Little Endian? 

```
Example
0x01234567

Memory address increases ->

Big Endian:
01 23 45 67

Little Endian
67 45 23 01

```
#### Important notes
- Bits are not reversed, as the low order bit is the reference point.
- Doesn‚Äôt affect chars, or strings (arrays of chars), as chars are only one byte

## **Chapter 2-1: Machine Programming: Basics** <a name="topic-2"></a>
[Back to Blog Chapters](#blog-chapters)

#### Intel x86 Processors
- x86 is a complex instruction set compter
- compare: RISC (reduced), which has very few instructions, can be quite fast(Intel still wins on speed), RISC renaissance(ARM), especially for low power
- Why Intel faster? Still runs RISC inside, internally the same

#### level of abstraction
- C vs Assembly vs Computer Design
#### Definitions
- Architecture: The parts of a processor design that one needs to understand for writing machine code
- Microarchitecture: Implementation of the architecture
- Code Forms: 
- - Mahine code: byte-level programs that a processor executes
- - Assembly Code: A text representation of machine code

#### Assembly/Machine Code View
- Programmer-Visible State
- - CPU(Registers, Program counter(Rip in x86-64), Condition codes) <----> Memory (Code, Data, Stack)

#### Assembly: Data Types
- Integer: 1,2,4,8 bytes
- Floating point data of 4,8,10 bytes
- SIMD vecter data types of 8,16,32,64 bytes
- Code: Byte sequences encoding series of instructions
- ops, src, dst


#### Registers
##### IA 32 registers
- eax, ecx, edx, ebx, esi, edi, esp, ebp

#### Moving Data
- movq source, Dest
- Constant integer data $0x400, $-533
- Register %rax, 
- Memmory: 8 consecutive bytes of memory at address given by register. Simplest example: (%rax)
- **Cannot do memory-memory transfer with a single instruction!**
```
Examples:
movq $0x4,%rax temp = 0x4;
movq $-147,(%rax) *p = -147;
movq %rax,%rdx temp2 = temp1;
movq %rax,(%rdx) *p = temp;
movq (%rax),%rdx temp = *p;

Mem[Reg[R]+D]: movq 8(%rbp),%rdx
Mem[Reg[Rb]+S*Reg[Ri]+ D]: 
- D: Constant ‚Äúdisplacement‚Äù 1, 2, or 4 bytes
- Rb: Base register: Any of 16 integer registers
- Ri: Index register: Any, except for %rsp
- S: Scale: 1, 2, 4, or 8 (why these numbers?) jump number of bytes, array of element of specific size

Special Cases
(Rb,Ri) Mem[Reg[Rb]+Reg[Ri]]
D(Rb,Ri) Mem[Reg[Rb]+Reg[Ri]+D]
(Rb,Ri,S) Mem[Reg[Rb]+S*Reg[Ri]]

```


<!-- 
- %rax / %eax
- %rbx / %ebx
- %rcx / %ecx
- %

 -->


#### Address Computation Instruction
- leaq Src, Dst
```
leaq (%rdi,%rdi,2), %rax    # t = x+2*x
salq $2, %rax               # return t<<2

```

#### GDB view - activity 1

```
rdi            0x1                 1
rsp            0x7fffffffe650      0x7fffffffe650
rax            0x4f                79
```

- By convention, %rax is used to store a function‚Äôs return value
- %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8, and %r9 are used to pass the first six integer or pointer parameters to called functions. Additional parameters (or large parameters such as structs passed by value) are passed on the stack.
- %rsp is used as the stack pointer, a pointer to the topmost element in the stack.



### Which numbers are pointers?
- rsp and rip always hold ptrs
- Register values that are "close" to these are probably also ptrs


#### CF ZF SF OF Condition codes
Single bit registers
- CF Carry Flag (for unsigned) SF Sign Flag (for signed)
- ZF Zero Flag OF Overflow Flag (for signed)
- GDB prints these as one ‚Äúeflags‚Äù register

```
CF set if carry out from most significant bit (unsigned overflow)
ZF set if t == 0
SF set if t < 0 (as signed)
OF set if two‚Äôs-complement (signed) overflow
(a>0 && b>0 && t<0) || (a<0 && b<0 && t>=0)

```

#### cmp a, b
- Computes ùëè ‚àí ùëé (just like sub)
- Sets condition codes based on result, but‚Ä¶
- Does not change ùíÉ

```
jX Condition Description
jmp 1 Unconditional
je ZF Equal / Zero
jne ~ZF Not Equal / Not Zero
js SF Negative
jns ~SF Nonnegative
jg ~(SF^OF)&~ZF Greater (Signed)
jge ~(SF^OF) Greater or Equal (Signed)
jl (SF^OF) Less (Signed)
jle (SF^OF)|ZF Less or Equal (Signed)
ja ~CF&~ZF Above (unsigned)
jb CF Below (unsigned)


‚ñ™ Set low-order byte of destination to 0 or 1 based on combinations of
condition codes
‚ñ™ Does not alter remaining 7 bytes
SetX Condition Description
sete ZF Equal / Zero
setne ~ZF Not Equal / Not Zero
sets SF Negative
setns ~SF Nonnegative
setg ~(SF^OF)&~ZF Greater (Signed)
setge ~(SF^OF) Greater or Equal (Signed)
setl (SF^OF) Less (Signed)
setle (SF^OF)|ZF Less or Equal (Signed)
seta ~CF&~ZF Above (unsigned)
setb CF Below (unsigned)


```

#### Using Conditional Moves
- can be bad: dup calc, unsafe, side-effects
- ?:


```
Expensive Computations
Bad Cases for Conditional Move
ÔÇ¢ Both values get computed
ÔÇ¢ Only makes sense when computations are very simple
val = Test(x) ? Hard1(x) : Hard2(x);
Risky Computations
ÔÇ¢ Both values get computed
ÔÇ¢ May have undesirable effects
val = p ? *p : 0;
Computations with side effects
- Both values get computed
- Must be side-effect free
```


```

Stack bottom (increasing addresses)


stk ptr -> 
Stack top (decreasing addresses, stk grows down)


```
- pushq src: fetch operand at src, decrement %rsp by 8, and write operand at address given by %rsp 
- pop: value is copied, in remains in memory at old %rsp
- ret knows where to go back: pop address from stack, and jump to address

#### Procedure data flow
- first 6 arguments: rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9
- return value: rax

- Stack: only allocate stack space when needed
```
...
Arg N
Arg N-1
...
Arg 2
Arg 1
```
- why not directly calc, sometimes use indirect registers for calc? may not maintain vals
- optional rbp for frame pointer. Most of the time the compiler can figure out the frame size. If compiler cannot find the frame size, it will use rbp.

Stack frame
```
Caller Frame(Arguments 7+, then return address)
Old rbp (optional)
saved registers and local variables
argument build (optional)
rsp
```

leaq 8(%rsp), %RDI
COMPUTES rsp + 8

#### Register Saving Converntions
- Caller saved: temporary vals saved in its frame before the call
- Callee Saved: rbx, r12, r13, r14, rbp

#### Obs of recursion
- handled without special consideration
- stack franes mean private storage
- saved registers, local vars and return ptr
- registers saving prevent one function call from corrupting another's data

#### also works for mutual recursion P <-> Q
#### Procedure Summary
- Stack for procedure call/return
- Recursion handled by normal converntions
- Pointers are addresses of values on stack or global



## **Chapter 3: Data** <a name="topic-3"></a>

[Back to Blog Chapters](#blog-chapters)

#### Reminder: Memory Organization
- data type and size
- ints(floats): 4000,4001,4003,4004
- longs(doubles): 4000-4007

#### Array Allocation
- char string [12], int val[5]...contiguously allocated
- char *p[3]: pointers to characters. Depends on machines. 64 bit assembly, therefore 8 byte for each pointer: [x,x+7], x+8, x+16, x+24...

#### Array Access
- if val[4] with int type int, int val[4]: x, x+4, x+8, ... x+20
- - val[5] has val ??
- - *(val+3) == val[3]
- - val is int * with value x 
- - &val[2] == val+2 == x+8
- - val + i == x+4*i


#### Multiple arrays
- Not guarantee to be consecutive for different arrays in memory

#### int arr[] vs int *arr[] vs int (*arr) []

#### Multidimensional Arrays
- R * C * sizeof(T) bytes
- consecutive R arrays, each of them with C elements
- A[i] -> A + i * (C * sizeof(T))
- A[i][j] -> A + i * (C * K) + j * K -> A + (i * C + j) * K: exactly what the assembly does
- int *univ[ucount] = {mit, cmu, ucb}
- - Mem[Mem[univ+8 * index]+4 * digit]


#### Structures & Alignment
- int: multiple of 4
- double: multiple of 8
- char:1, short:2, float,int:4, long,double,char*: 8
- Important: overall struct needs to be aligned - biggest element in the struct
- end struct *p with multiple of 8 with char, int and double

<!-- This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

```c++
int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 * bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

```markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
```

Which displays:

1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.
   1. Like this:
      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
    string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %} -->
