Hello! I started on my academic journey in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I graduated with honors. Currently, I am enriching my knowledge in the field of Information Networking at Carnegie Mellon University.

While at UW-Madison, I had the honor of being advised by [Professor Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/index.html), whose guidance greatly influenced my research interests in computer networks. During my undergraduate studies, I also had the invaluable opportunity to conduct research in collaboration with [Dr. Amrita Mazumdar](https://research.nvidia.com/person/amrita-mazumdar) from NVIDIA Research. These experiences allowed me to apply my academic knowledge to practical challenges in research and advanced my understanding of the field.


My technical ambitions lie in building innovative and efficient full-stack applications aimed at making people's lives happier and easier. 

Outside of work, you might find me enjoying developing interesting applications or reading literatures. 'Missing Person' by Patrick Modiano - it's my all-time favorite read! 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
